  abstract = "Archaeogenetic research over the last decade has demonstrated
              that European Neolithic farmers (ENFs) were descended primarily
              from Anatolian Neolithic farmers (ANFs). ENFs, including early
              Neolithic central European Linearbandkeramik (LBK) farming
              communities, also harbored ancestry from European Mesolithic
              hunter gatherers (WHGs) to varying extents, reflecting admixture
              between ENFs and WHGs. However, the timing and other details of
              this process are still imperfectly understood. In this report, we
              provide a bioarchaeological analysis of three individuals
              interred at the Brunn 2 site of the Brunn am Gebirge-Wolfholz
              archeological complex, one of the oldest LBK sites in central
              Europe. Two of the individuals had a mixture of WHG-related and
              ANF-related ancestry, one of them with approximately 50\% of
              each, while the third individual had approximately all
              ANF-related ancestry. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios
              for all three individuals were within the range of variation
              reflecting diets of other Neolithic agrarian populations.
              Strontium isotope analysis revealed that the ~50\% WHG-ANF
              individual was non-local to the Brunn 2 area. Overall, our data
              indicate interbreeding between incoming farmers, whose ancestors
              ultimately came from western Anatolia, and local HGs, starting
              within the first few generations of the arrival of the former in
              central Europe, as well as highlighting the integrative nature
              and composition of the early LBK communities.",
